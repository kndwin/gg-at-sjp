# Preparing your Testimony

1.  Think about the last time you shared your Christian testimony. What
surprised you about sharing? What encouragements can you think of?
If you can't remember the last time you shared your testimony,
discuss why this might be so. (5 minutes)

2.  Recall the definition of a Christian Testimony from the Bible talk
on Sunday. Fill in the blanks. (2 minutes)

```
_____________ story, through __________ story,
Spoken to your ______________ story.
```

3.  What is helpful about that definition? Is there anything you would
change? (5 minutes)

## Breakout Group # 1

The definition of a Christian testimony contained 3 components. We will
focus some Bible study on the first component tonight, God's Story - The
Gospel. Our Bible study focus will move to the next two components in
subsequent weeks of growth group. The goal of these weeks is highly
practical, to have every member prepare a clear, compelling and gospel
focused testimony ready to be 'pulled out of our back pocket'.

4.  Let's have a look at the Bible. Acts 2:36; 3:13-15; 4:10; 13:32-33;
    17:31-32; 26:23; Romans 1:2-4 (15 minutes)

5.  What would be the problem if your testimony focused too much on your
    'audience's story?' (5 minutes)

6.  What would be the problem if the testimony focused too much on 'your
    story of transformation'? (5 minutes)

PRACTICE

7.  Growth Group leader to share their testimony. Did it have the
