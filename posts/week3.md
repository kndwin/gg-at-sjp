# Your Story

How have you felt about writing your testimonies over the past few weeks?
Have you found it easy/difficult? What areas were easy/difficult?


> Sharing your testimony can be an incredibly scary and daunting thing for some people. Sometimes, in sharing their journey to becoming a Christian they might reveal a part of their life and their personality that they might only reveal to their closest friends or not to anyone. For others, sharing their journey can be as easy as sharing what they had for lunch. 

> It all depends on our individual circumstances and how comfortable we may or may not be in making ourselves vulnerable to others.

> In Sam Chan’s “Everyday Evangelism” he suggests that we present our testimonies, our journey to becoming a Christian, in the form of a true ‘story’ with a beginning, middle and end.


## Breakout Room - 25 mins
Nominate someone to share one or two points to the main group when we come back

Below is a condensed summary of how Sam Chan suggests to structure ‘your story’.

Take a few moments to read through the summary, thinking about how you might answer some of the questions:

1. Introduction: Introduce you, Who are you? Set the context for the bulk of your story
2. Definition of mission/motive: What was your mission/motive? What was your mission in life? What was your God-given drive in life?
3. Body: Show how you tried to satisfy your drives but ultimately found it to be impossible without God (examples will help)
4. Bridge: Introduce Jesus and how he satisfies your desires and mission
5. Climax: Explain how you decided to follow Jesus - can be a long, drawn out process with no clear point or it may be a single point
6. Resolution: Explain what living with Jesus looks like now - how does he continue to satisfy your drives or give you new ones?

- Is there anything missing from Sam Chan’s story structure?

> Note: Sam Chan’s idea of telling ‘your story’ is that it will be a one of two separate conversations where the following conversation focuses solely on telling ‘God’s story’ - Jesus resurrection, through a similar structure.


- What are some examples of missions in life that you or other people may have?
- What kinds of things would seem to satisfy those missions or desires? Do they? Why or why not?
- How might Jesus satisfy or alter those missions or desires? Does He?
## Come back together - 10 mins

Each group to share one or two points from their Breakout Room

> Hopefully as you have discussed the previous questions, you have been thinking about how you might express your individual journeys’ through this structure. Throughout the week, answer those questions for yourself (if you haven’t already) and begin to form a story out of ‘your story’. You don’t have to use this structure to tell your story but it may give you a different perspective on how your journey can be expressed. 

## Break - 5 mins
## ‘Your Audience’s Story’

> It goes without saying that your testimony should change depending on who you are delivering it to but how it changes depends on how much you know about your audience.

- How does considering and understanding our audience help with Gospel proclamation?


## Breakout Room - 20 mins
Nominate one person to share answers in the main group

**Read the following passages:**
```
1 Corinthians 1: 22-25;    	
Acts 17: 16-34;    			
Acts 25:16-21 & Acts 26:1-8
```

**Answer the following questions for each passage:**
- What is going on in the passage? Who is the audience in the passage?
- What are we taught about understanding our audience’s story and its importance?
- How does Paul move from ‘understanding the audience’ to ‘inserting his own story’?

## Come back together - 10 mins

Each group to share answers from their Breakout Rooms

## Prayer / Homework - 20 mins

Pray for wisdom! The wisdom to see opportunities to share your story with others. The wisdom to link your story with God’s story. And the wisdom to recognise and adapt your story to the audience you deliver it to.

May also be good to pray for specific people in your life that you can practice delivering your testimony to and to get their feedback on

For next week, you may want to rework your testimony to align more with Sam’s structure or you may want to alter the focus or the body of jyour testimony in light of the study.
