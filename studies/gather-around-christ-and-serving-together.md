# ‚òï serving together (90 mins)
#### scripture
<details>
  <summary>
  Romans 12
  </summary>

  > Therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.
> 
> For by the grace given to me, I tell everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he should think. Instead, think sensibly, as God has distributed a measure of faith to each one. Now as we have many parts in one body, and all the parts do not have the same function, in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another. According to the grace given to us, we have different gifts:
> 
> If prophecy,
> use it according to the standard of one‚Äôs faith;
> if service, in service;
> if teaching, in teaching;
> if exhorting, in exhortation;
> giving, with generosity;
> leading, with diligence;
> showing mercy, with cheerfulness.

#### what has God graced you with? (Some quotes below to help you think) (30 mins)
> "According to the grace given to us, we have different gifts" 
<br> - Paul the Apostle (Romans - Chapter 12:5)


> ""It can be harder than it sounds sometimes to find someone's gift. Some people's awesome sits closer to the surface. But other have an awesome hidden under layers of awkwardness, ineptitude, nonchalance, or ingrained mediocrity. Are you convinced that everyone is gifted and that there is awesome within everyone? Theologically you might know this to be true, but do you believe it in a way that affects how you act and talk and develop people?"
<br> - Craig Hamilton (Wisdom in Leadership - Chapter 47. Find the Awesome)

> "Marcus Buckingham, who has been writing about this subject [Our strengths] for years, has redefined strengths and weaknesses in a very helpful way. He says that we usually define strenghts as the things we're good at and weaknesses as the things that we don't do as well. This, he says, is close but not close enough. Sometimes it's true, but it's not always true. Instead, he says, we should define strengths as activities that make us stronger. After doing these activities we feel alive, satisfied, energized. The time seems to fly by when we're engaged in these activities = hours feel like minutes. And our weakneses are those activities that make us feel weaker, drained, and tired. While we're doing these things time turns to molasses - minutes feel like hours."
<br> - Craig Hamilton (Wisdom in Leadership - Chapter 14. Play to your strengths)
