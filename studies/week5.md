**Preparing & Sharing Your Testimony**

Study 5 â€“ Summary & Testimony Sharing

**Write your own Testimony**

**<u>Godâ€™s</u>** Story, through **<u>Your</u>** Story, Spoken to your
**<u>Audienceâ€™s</u>** Story.

Sam Chan provides a helpful structure to frame a testimony. There is a
significant emphasis on your story and your audienceâ€™s story, as he
invites the audience to hear the gospel separately. We want to weave the
gospel into the testimony, so that it is Godâ€™s Story, through your
story, spoken to your audienceâ€™s story.

-   **Introduction**: Introduce you, Who are you? Set the context for
    the bulk of your story

-   **Definition of mission/motive**: What was your mission/motive? What
    was your mission in life? What was your God-given drive in life?

-   **Body**: Show how you tried to satisfy your drives but ultimately
    found it to be impossible without God (examples will help)

-   **Bridge**: Introduce Jesus and how he satisfies your desires and
    mission

-   **Climax**: Explain how you decided to follow Jesus - can be a long,
    drawn out process with no clear point or it may be a single point

-   **Resolution**: Explain what living with Jesus looks like now - how
    does he continue to satisfy your drives or give you new ones?

1.  Using either structure or what you have learnt so far, write down
    your testimony. Pick someone who you want to share your testimony
    to, and tailor/â€™speakâ€™ your story to them.
